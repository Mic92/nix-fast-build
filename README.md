# nix-fast-build ðŸš€ (previously known as nix-ci-build)

Combine the power of `nix-eval-jobs` with `nix-output-monitor` to speed-up your
evaluation and building process. `nix-fast-build` an also integrates with remote
machines by uploading the current flake, performing the evaluation/build
remotely, and then transferring the resultant store paths back to you.

## Why `nix-fast-build`?

**Problem**: Evaluating and building big flakes i.e. with numerous NixOS
machines can be painfully slow. For instance, rebuilding the already-compiled
[disko integration test suite](https://github.com/nix-community/disko) demands
1:50 minutes on an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D. But, it only takes a
[10 seconds](https://github.com/Mic92/nix-fast-build/issues/1) with
`nix-fast-build`.

**Solution**: `nix-fast-build` makes builds faster by evaluating and building
your nix packages concurrently, reducing the overall time.

## How Does It Work?

Under the hood:

1. It leverages the output from `nix-eval-jobs` to evaluate flake attributes in
   parallel.
2. As soon as attributes complete evaluation, `nix-fast-build` initiates their
   build, even if the overall evaluation is ongoing.
3. Lastly, `nix-output-monitor` to show the build progress nicely.
4. (Optional) Once a build finishes, `nix-fast-build` can initiate its upload to
   a designated remote binary cache.

## Usage

To get started, run:

```console
$ nix-fast-build
```

or:

```
$ nix run github:Mic92/nix-fast-build
```

This command will concurrently evaluate all systems in `.#checks` and build the
attributes in `.#checks.$currentSystem`.

Enjoy faster and more efficient NixOS builds with `nix-fast-build`!

## Remote building

When leveraging the remote-builder protocol, uploading pre-built paths or
sources from the local machine can often turn into a bottleneck.
`nix-fast-build` does not use the remote-builder protocol. Instead it uploads
only the flake and executes all evaluation/build operations on the remote end.
At the end `nix-fast-build` will download the finished builds to the local
machine while not having to download all build dependencies in between.

Here is how to use it:

```
nix run github:Mic92/nix-fast-build -- --remote youruser@yoursshhostname
```

Replace `youruser@yoursshhostname` with your SSH login credentials for the
target machine. Please note that as of now, you must be recognized as a trusted
user on the remote endpoint to access this feature.

## CI-Friendly Output

By default, `Nix-output-monitor` (abbreviated as `nom`) updates its output every
0.5 seconds. In standard terminal environments, this frequent update is
unnoticeable, as `nom` erases the previous output before displaying the new one.
However, in Continuous Integration (CI) systems, each update appears as a
separate line of output.

To make output more concise for CI environments, use the `--no-nom` flag. This
replaces `nom` with a streamlined status reporter, which updates only when
there's a change in the number of pending builds, uploads, or downloads.

## Avoiding Redundant Package Downloads

By default, `nix build` will download pre-built packages, leading to needless
downloads even when there are no changes to any package. This can be especially
burdensome for CI environments without a persistent Nix store, such as GitHub
Actions.

To optimize this, use the `--skip-cached` flag with `nix-fast-build`. This
ensures that only those packages missing from the binary caches will be built.

## Specifying Build Systems

By default, `nix-fast-build` evaluates all architectures but only initiates
builds for the current system. You can modify this behavior with the `--systems`
flag. For instance, using `--systems "aarch64-linux x86_64-linux"` will prompt
builds for both `aarch64-linux` and `x86_64-linux` architectures. Ensure that
your system is capable of building for the specified architectures, either
locally or through the remote builder protocol.

## Building different flake attributes

`nix-fast-build` by default builds `.#checks.$currentSystem`, which refers to
all checks for the current flake. You can modify this default behavior by using
the `--flake` flag to specify a different attribute path.

Example:

```console
$ nix run github:Mic92/nix-fast-build -- --flake github:NixOS/nixpkgs#legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.hello
```

**Note:** Always provide the complete flake path. Unlike `nix build`,
`nix-fast-build` does not iterate over different attributes; the full path must
be explicitly stated.

## Only evaluate the current system

By default nix-fast-build will evaluate all systems in `.#checks`, you can limit
it to the current system by using this command:

```console
$ nix run github:Mic92/nix-fast-build -- --skip-cached --no-nom --flake ".#checks.$(nix eval --raw --impure --expr builtins.currentSystem)"
```

## Cachix support

nix-fast-build can upload to cachix like this:

```console
$ nix-fast-build --cachix-cache mic92
```

nix-fast-build assumes that your current machine is either logged in to cachix
or has the environment variables `CACHIX_SIGNING_KEY` or `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN`
set. These environment variables are currently not propagated to ssh when using
the `--remote` flag, instead the user is expected that cachix credentials are
configured on the remote machine.

## Attic support

nix-fast-build can upload to attic like this:

```console
$ nix-fast-build --attic-cache mic92
```

nix-fast-build assumes that your current machine is either logged in to attic.
Authentication is not propagated to ssh when using the `--remote` flag, instead
the user is expected that attic credentials are configured on the remote
machine.

## Machine-readable builds results

nix-fast-build supports both its own json format and junit:

Example for json output:

```console
nix-fast-build --result-file result.json
cat ./result.json
{
   "results": [
     {
       "attr": "riscv64-linux.package-default",
       "duration": 0.0,
       "error": null,
       "success": true,
       "type": "EVAL"
     },
# ...
```

Example for junit result output:

```console
nix-fast-build --result-format junit --result-file result.xml
```

```console
nix-shell -p python3Packages.junit2html --run 'junit2html result.xml result.html'
```

## GitHub Actions Job Summaries

nix-fast-build can automatically generate GitHub Actions job summaries when running
in GitHub Actions. The summary includes:

- Overall build status
- Success/failure counts by operation type (EVAL, BUILD, UPLOAD, etc.)
- Detailed sections for failed builds with logs

### Automatic Detection

When running in GitHub Actions (detected via `GITHUB_ACTIONS` environment variable),
nix-fast-build will automatically write a summary to the file specified by the
`GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` environment variable:

```yaml
- name: Build with nix-fast-build
  run: nix-fast-build --no-nom --skip-cached
```

### Custom Summary File

You can override the summary file location with the `--github-summary` flag:

```console
nix-fast-build --github-summary /tmp/summary.md
```

This is useful for:
- Testing the summary generation locally
- Using custom locations in CI environments
- Generating summaries outside of GitHub Actions

The summary includes collapsible log sections for failed builds, making it easy to
diagnose issues without leaving the GitHub Actions UI.
